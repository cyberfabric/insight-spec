-- Bronze → Silver step 1: Claude Admin Claude Code usage → class_ai_dev_usage
--
-- Source: bronze_claude_admin.claude_admin_code_usage — daily Claude Code
-- activity from /v1/organizations/usage_report/claude_code. Filtered to
-- actor_type='user' so actor_identifier carries the user email.
--
-- Note: Claude Code usage is also present in Enterprise data (claude_enterprise_users.code_*)
-- but we deliberately take it from claude-admin only, per the lead's rule: data
-- available in the common Admin API is always sourced from there to avoid double
-- counting in class_ai_dev_usage aggregates.
--
-- Aggregation: claude_admin_code_usage has one row per
-- (date, actor_identifier, terminal_type) — we aggregate across terminal_type
-- to match class_ai_dev_usage granularity (tenant, email, day, tool).
